# Hi, I'm Vinay

- I’m a Deep Learning student with a mind wired for patterns.  
- Obsessive about AI, autonomy, and clean mental models.  
- This space holds fragments—raw, messy, and real.  
- I have AuDHD—it sharpens my perception, but scrambles the obvious.  
- I freeze at simple instructions, but decipher complexity like a puzzle in the dark.  
- My workflow is erratic—bursts of focus surrounded by fog.
